# Birthday-Greetings-Automator
This Python script automates the process of sending birthday emails to friends or contacts based on the data provided in a CSV file (birthdays.csv). The program reads the CSV file to create a dictionary of birthdays, and if it's someone's birthday today, it selects a random letter template and sends a personalized birthday email.
